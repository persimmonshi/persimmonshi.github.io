        <p>I set the github for a long time but do not know what to write in the github, and in the period of epidemic situation, we use a lot electric device,and write the article.</p>
<p>When we talk of social media, we see an increasing number of teenagers using the medium such as Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, QQ, WeChat and others have already become a significant addition to their lives. And they may use the internet to Teenagers are using social media in order to stay in touch with their friends, make new friends, keep themselves up to date with what’s trending, Shop online, search for some news and information and so on. Social media has its advantages and disadvantages in some ways affects the lives of teenagers, so let us take a look at some of these effects.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages of Social Media Use by Teens</strong></p>
<p>When young people use social media, young people can find the up to date news and information.” I have seen that my nephew knows more about the latest developments in the world than any other member of the family does. News and information break out faster on social media than it does on traditional media. By staying on social media, teenagers know more about global happenings and issues affecting the world. Issues like Global Warming, Terrorism, Sexual Harassment, and other happenings keep adding to their knowledge base.” (Ahmed, April 26, 2019) About some of the news young people don not know, young people can also realize them. But Ahmed is a Part-time blogger, so his opinion can only represent some of the citizens in the world, he may also have some bias and it is not very current. It means that this is the weak evidence. Also, according to the Australian Bureau of statistics, teenagers are spending up to 18 hours per week online and 91 percent of teens aged 15 to 19 report using social media. Online and social media use plays a significant role in the lives of today’s youth. But this research is only carried out in Australia, so it is not embraced all the teenagers and it can only represent the young people in Australia.</p>
<p>In addition, the social media can also support networks in young people’s lives. Having positive online networks helped young people in care gain social skills. Digital networks were also found to help bond a fragmented social life and act as a bridge beyond the immediate environment. “Having a strong social support network helps with the physical and psychological isolation reported by young people in care,” said Dr Hammond. “We found that emotional support from people outside the care environment was very important. Keeping up to date with friends and, in some cases birth family members, about everyday life events really helped provide a sense of belonging and connectedness.” (Anglia, February 2, 2018 ) It is a research of a university and Dr Hammond is a expert, so their conclusion is depended on a lot of practice without any bias, and this is the strong evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Disadvantages of Social Media Use by Teens</strong></p>
<p>Many parents worry about how exposure to technology might affect infants developmentally. Almost all of us don’t want hours are spent on an iPad to impede that. But adolescence is an equally important period of rapid development, and too few of us are paying attention to how our teenagers’ use of technology. It may bring teens some defects. Because of the social media are the indirect communication but not face to face ones. Rachel Ehmke (Ehmke, 2019)has a opinion that When children are not doing their homework, they’re online and on their phones, texting, sharing, trolling, scrolling. Although they may do something not on their phones, they were more likely to do their chatting on the phone, or in person when hanging out at the mall. It may have looked like a lot of aimless hanging around, but what they were doing was experimenting and succeeding and failing in tons of tiny real-time interactions that kids today are missing out on. For one thing, modern teens are learning to do most of their communication while looking at a screen, not another person. “As a species we are very highly attuned to reading social cues,” says Dr. Catherine Steiner-Adair, a clinical psychologist and author of The Big Disconnect. “There’s no question kids are missing out on very critical social skills. In a way, texting and online communicating—it’s not like it creates a nonverbal learning disability, but it puts everybody in a nonverbal disabled context, where body language, facial expression, and even the smallest kinds of vocal reactions are rendered invisible.” Rachel Ehmke is managing editor at the Child Mind Institute and Dr. Catherine Steiner-Adair is a clinical psychologist and author. Both of them are the experts of children activities and there are no bias. Although the evidences are not very meticulous, they are credible and credible for us.</p>
<p>Moreover, the author Leslie Walker (Walker, December 16, 2019 ) addiction usually refers to compulsive behavior that leads to negative effects. In most addictions, people feel compelled to do certain activities so often that they become a harmful habit, which then interferes with other important activities such as work or school. Researchers at Chicago University concluded that social media addition can also be stronger than addiction to cigarettes and booze following an experiment in which they recorded the cravings of several hundred people for several weeks. Media cravings ranked ahead of cravings for cigarettes and alcohol. Leslie Walker is a multimedia journalism professor who covers social media, web publishing, and internet technologies, although he is a professor in this region, he is not the expert of teenagers and the evidence he wrote may not the same as that as young people, so it is a weak evidence.</p>
<p>In conclusion, in the article I would like to compare the cons and pros of social media for teenagers. I confirmedly think that the cons are outweigh the pros only for young people all the time with the most significant reason that teens are lack of ability of self-control. If I would like to reinforce my standpoint, ii need to know more about something about the psychology and habits of teens.</p>
